# MathLearningGame
This project is for my school project
> ### What is it meant to do?
> Help teach the Year 9/Lower students maths
> but in a FUN learning way to motivate them to learn more :>
## How does the game work?
__First__: The Teacher starts up the server, Sets a Name for it, Amount of students in her/his class, And level of difficulty and then presses start  


__Second__: The Server will take that input and generate a 5 pin passcode and display it in bold on the screen thus with all of the users in the game. It'll also include buttons for the teacher incase they want to change the settings  


__Third__: The Student will then launch the client on the student computers and join in, It'll ask for the code, Name, and Nickname once set, then Display the word "Waiting" on they're screen  


__Forth__: Once all of the students are in, The Teacher can then press Start and then the game will begin, A count down will begin and once finished the server will display a List of all the users on a race track, After it'll send the different questions to each student  


__Fifth__: As you probably already know, The student will type in they're answer and then the server will determine if it's true or not, If its true they'll move up in the race, If it's not then they're stay still  


__Sixth__: In order for the students to complete the race, they'll have to get a max of 20 questions correct before either someone else does or the timer runs out P.S: The timer will be set to 5 minutes  


__Seventh__: If the student completes them all then the game will end, And will tell everyone how who came first second and third and the teacher can decide either if they want to quit or start it again

## More to come in the future
